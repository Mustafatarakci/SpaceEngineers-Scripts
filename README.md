# SpaceEngineers-Scripts

This repo contains all my ingame scripts for Space Engineers. Also included is my Script Compiler which uses Dawnkeeper's ClipCopy script. This enables me to implement scripts with several .cs files and merge them for ingame usage. It also enabled the easy usage of libraries which can be reused in scripts without manually copying the code.

Feel free to reuse and copy my code whenever or whereever you want to.
